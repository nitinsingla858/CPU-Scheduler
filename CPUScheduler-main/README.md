The Simulation Website of CPU Scheduling Algorithm is an interactive platform designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority, and other popular algorithms.

The website provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their own data, including the number of processes, arrival time, burst time, priority, and time quantum. The website then visualizes the scheduling process and displays the results in real-time, providing a clear understanding of how the algorithm works and how it affects system performance.

This simulation website is an excellent tool for students, educators, and professionals who are interested in learning about CPU scheduling algorithms and their practical applications. It provides a hands-on learning experience that allows users to experiment with different scheduling algorithms and understand their impact on system performance.
